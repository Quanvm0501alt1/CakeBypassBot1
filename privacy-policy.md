Discord Guild IDs: To identify the servers the Bot is in and where commands are used.

Command Usage: Records of which commands are used, when, and by which user and in which guild.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use the data we collect strictly for the following purposes:

Statistical Analysis: Aggregated, anonymized command usage data may be used for statistical purposes to understand bot usage patterns, but this data will not identify individual users or guilds.

We will not sell, rent, distribute, or otherwise commercialize your personal data in any form. We will not use your data for any illegal purposes.
